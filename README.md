# Aled Wassell | Front-end Developer
I am Aled Wassell from the UK, living in Tokyo and working as an English teacher by day, studying code by night.

# Mission
To get my first job as a front-end developer in 2017!
Challenging eh?

# What I now Know.
I have studied Javascript and core programming theory every evening and weekend since February 2016.
I think I have found my calling!
I really enjoy learning to code and exploring the world of tech has opened my eyes as to how tech can help people.
I think I want to build products that help people who have a disability.
